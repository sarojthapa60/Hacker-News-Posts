# Hacker-News-Posts
The goal of this project is to analyze what kind of posts from Hacker News and at what time receive the most comments.

In this project, we will compare two different types of posts from Hacker News, a popular site where technology related stories (or posts) are voted and commented upon.The two types of posts we will explore begin with either Ask HN or Show HN.

Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question, such as "What is the best online Python for Data Science course you have ever taken?" Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

The goal of this project is to compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

Do Ask HN or Show HN recieve more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
The data set can be found at Hacker News Posts. It should be noted that the data set we are working with was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.
